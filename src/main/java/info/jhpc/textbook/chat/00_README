This directory contains a lot of stuff.

There is code that specifically is designed to support remote calls
using SocketServer and Socket classes. You are expected to use this
code for the Chat implementation.

The key classes are:

RemoteCallServer - this is a generic server for remote calls.

RemoteCallClient - this is a generic client. It is needed to issue calls
	to a RemoteCallServer instance.

CallMessage - An abstract class that can be used to create remote call
	messages.

Callable - An interface that any class that wants to be remote must 
	implement.

Goodbye - A reserved message that can be used to zap a particular
	client/server session.



ChatClientLogin - the main login screen

ChatClientRoom - the client room, which is launched upon successful login
	and is used to carry out the chat

ChatServer - this is the remote object that maanges the chat room.
ChatUserData - this is used to maintain state for each user joining the
	chat.

ChatLogin - a message used to login to the ChatServer
ChatSession - a reply message used to pass the session ID back to client
GetMessages - used to request messages for a particular user.
Logout - a message used to Logout of the chat room.
Ok.java - an acknowledgment message. Also can be used to notify of
	errors.

PutMessage - used to send a message to the chat room.

You'll need to add other message types for this assignment. I think this
provides an excellent starting point for you to work from.
