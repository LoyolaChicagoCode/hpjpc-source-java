/**
 * A Monitor with condition variables, similar to those defined by Hoare and
 * Brinch-Hansen. A class with methods declared synchronized is Java's standard
 * version of a monitor.
 * <p>
 * The condition variables are provided by the inner class Condition.
 * <p>
 * To use this monitor to protect your class, you must either have your class
 * extend Monitor, like this bounded buffer example:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class BoundedBuffer3 extends Monitor{
 * Condition notEmpty=new Condition();
 * Condition notFull=new Condition();
 * <p/>
 * volatile int hd=0,tl=0;
 * Object[] buffer;
 * public BoundedBuffer3(int size) {
 *    buffer=new Object[size];
 * }
 * public void put(Object v)
 *        throws InterruptedException {
 *    enter();
 *    if(tl - hd >= buffer.length) notFull.await();
 *    buffer[tl++ % buffer.length] = v;
 *    notEmpty.signal();
 *    leave();
 * }
 * public Object get()
 *        throws InterruptedException {
 *    enter();
 *    Object v;
 *    if (tl==hd) notEmpty.await();
 *    v = buffer[hd++ % buffer.length];
 *    notFull.signal();
 *    leave();
 *    return v;
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote> or use a separate monitor <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class BoundedBuffer4 {
 * Monitor mon = new Monitor();
 * Monitor.Condition notEmpty = mon.new Condition();
 * Monitor.Condition notFull = mon.new Condition();
 * <p/>
 * volatile int hd=0,tl=0;
 * Object[] buffer;
 * public BoundedBuffer4(int size) {
 *    buffer=new Object[size];
 * }
 * public void put(Object v)
 *        throws InterruptedException {
 *    mon.enter();
 *    if(tl - hd >= buffer.length) notFull.await();
 *    buffer[tl++ % buffer.length] = v;
 *    notEmpty.signal();
 *    mon.leave();
 * }
 * public Object get()
 *        throws InterruptedException {
 *    mon.enter();
 *    Object v;
 *    if (tl==hd) notEmpty.await();
 *    v = buffer[hd++ % buffer.length];
 *    notFull.leaveWithSignal();
 *    return v;
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote> A Monitor must be entered with an enter() call. It is left by a
 * call of leave(). You may enter the same monitor more than once, e.g. calling
 * one monitor-protected method from another. You must leave, of course, as many
 * times as you enter.
 * <p>
 * <p/>
 * Condition is an inner class. It must be created within a monitor object. It
 * represents a condition that a thread may wish to wait on.
 * <p>
 * To wait for condition C to hold, a thread calls <blockquote> C.await();
 * </blockquote> To signal that a condition holds, a thread calls <blockquote>
 * C.signal(); </blockquote> If one or more threads are awaiting the condition
 * at the time of a signal, one of them will be given control of the monitor
 * immediately. The thread executing the signal() will wait to reacquire the
 * monitor.
 * <p>
 * To both signal a condition and leave the monitor simultaneously, you can call
 * leaveWithSignal(). It is more efficient than a signal() followed by a
 * leave(), since it does not have to wait to reacquire the monitor before
 * executing the leave(). <blockquote> C.leaveWithSignal(); </blockquote> Be
 * sure you declare the fields of the Monitor-protected class to be
 * <b>volatile</b>.
 * <p>
