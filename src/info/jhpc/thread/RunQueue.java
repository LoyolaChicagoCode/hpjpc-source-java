 * Runnable objects are placed in this queue to be executed in threads. It has

 * <p>
 * A limit may be placed on the maximum number of Xeq threads that can be
 * created at a time to avoid clogging the system with too many threads. This,
 * however, can lead to deadlock if the threads wait on conditions that objects
 * later in the queue will cause.
